## All About Budgeting

That could be resources like materials, or money, or people.

*Task: Go to MSP and add resources and cost*
*Task: Finish Draft Project Charter by 10-9*

## Introduction

- A budget must be developed in order to obtain the needed resources
- A budget is a plan for allocating organizational resources to the project

## Budgeting Problems

- Projects are unique activities
- No history to aid estimators
- Projects may be multi-year with cost escalations
	- Changes in technology, materials, and process
- Organizational tradition impacts project budgeting
	- How overhead and indirect costs are charged
	- Specific legal issues
	- accounting idiosyncrasies
- Project managers see costs differently than accountants
	- Accountants treat costs linearly

## Top-Down Budgeting

- Based on collective judgements and experiences of top and middle managers
- Overall project cost estimated by estimating the sots of major tasks
- Advantages
	- Accuracy of estimating overall budget

## Bottom-Up Budgeting

- WAS identifies elemental tasks
- Those responsible for executing these tasks estimate the cost of the task

## Cost Estimating

- Details of the process of estimating costs
- Some dangers of arbitrary cuts in the budget
- Difference between activity budgeting and program budgeting

## Work Element Costing

- Determine resource requirements and then costs for each task
	- Fixed costs
	- Labor time and labor rate
	- equipment time and equipment rate
	- overhead
	- general, sales, and administrative
- Full cost budgeting is used by accounting to estimate the profit of the project
- Project manager may also construct a budget of direct costs
	- This provides information required to manage the project without being confronted with costs over which she has no control

## The Impact of Budget Cuts

- Top-down budgets are usually lower than bottom-up budgets
	- Job always looks easier, faster, and cheaper to the manager
	- Managers are usually optimistic
	- Subordinates are usually pessimistic
- To resolve difference...
	- Subordinate explains the reality of the task
	- Both parties search for efficiencies
	- Resolving remaining difference depends on the type of project
