## "Victimless" Crimes

- Ecclesiastical Courts
	- Non-traditional sex """offenses"""
	- Moral offenses
- Monarchies
- Lack of agreement regarding punishment for victimless crimes
	- Deep rift
	- How far should criminal law go to preserve "morals"?
- Acrimonious debate
	- Laws prohibiting "sin crimes"
		- Prostitution
			- Requires three elements
				- Prostitute providing the service
				- Client (John) buying the service
				- Usually a third party (pimp)
			- Double standard, never went after the clients
				- Served to oppress women
				- "Men are reform-able, women are not"
			- Three types in effect today:
				- Punish prostitute
				- Punish both, but prostitute most severely
				- Enforce equally on client and prostitute
		- Homosexuality
		- Drugs
	- Some old coots believe that this protects public good, but hopefully their vacation homes fall into the rising ocean.
