## Rationales for Criminal Attempt Law

### Act

- Focusses on the actions taken (actus reus)
- Closer to the act -> more serious

### Person

- Focusses on the intents of the person (mens rea)

## Types of Attempt Statutes

### General

- Have a statute against a crime detailing the requirements
- "Attempt" statute that defines an attempt

### Specific

- Have a statute against a crime detailing the requirements
- A separate state against attempting a crime

## Tests for the Attempt

### Last Act Rule

- If every act but the last is present, it's an attempt
- Problem: there are acts we want to apply criminal intent to that wouldn't be covered by this

### Proximity Tests

- Dangerous Proximity to Success Test
	- If the act was dangerously close to occurring, it's an attempt
		- What is still required for the defendant to complete the crime?
- Indispensable Element
	- There's an element that needs to be present in order to complete the crime
	- What has *already* been accomplished to commit the crime?
	- Drug dealers must *have* the drugs to be an attempt to sell drugs
- Unequivocality Test
	- "The act speaks for itself"
- Probable Desistance Test
	- Unlikely the defendant will turn back at this point in completion
- Model Penal Code
	- Requirements
		- Substantial Steps to complete the crime
		- Steps show purpose of the defendant
	- Goal is to pick up more people earlier along the line to completing a crime
	- Neutralize dangerous persons
