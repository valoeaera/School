# Chapter 10 Notes

## CSC - Common Law

Intentional forced nonconsensual heterosexual v****** penetration (not married)
*THIS DEFINITION IS SO BAD, I HATE IT*

### Elements

1. Force/threat of SBI - Actus Reus
2. Intentionally v****** intercourse
3. Man & Woman
4. w/o consent

*F--- this chapter*

Originally only recognized two sex offenses:

- Common Law R***
- Common Law S*****

## CSC - Modern Law

Legislatures and courts start redefining statutes to expand the definition of CSC
Skewed by lack of reporting

Goes from the specific, terrible definition above to something more like:
"Intentional forced nonconsensual sex" (No gender, No body parts, much better)

Statutes:

- Grading (aggravating factors)
- Non-consent, Force, and Resistance (most states have done away with this)
- Corroboration (most states have done away with this)
- Victim's Sexual History (most states have done away with this)
	- Cannot ask about victim's sexual history (except w/ defendant)
	- Will shut down the entire deposition
- Marital Exception
	- It is a crime now (some exceptions)
	- California has a separate crime? Weird
	- Reporting time is shorter
	- Less severe sentences
