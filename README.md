# Valerie's School Repository

This is a place to store notes, code, and reports for my University career which I unfortunately started in my Senior year.

## Current Initiatives

- District Docket
    - This project is for my CSIT capstone (which is different than the above capstone)
    - The code for this project doesn't reside here because we are working with the Dekalb County Community Partnership and is thus not available to publish here
- Delta Chi
    - This is where I store anything Delta Chi Fraternity-related that I can publish

## Past Initiatives

- Criminal-Law
    - During my first-semester senior year, I took a Criminal Law class and this is where my notes are stored
- HTB
    - HTB
        - Writeups for the HTB machines I've solved
    - HTB-Pics
        - Screenshots used in said reports
    - HTB-scripts
        - Any scripts used to solve the above machines
- Project-Management
    - During my first-semester senior year, I also took a Project-Management class and this is where my notes are stored
