# Valerie's School Repository

This is a place to store notes, code, and reports for my University career which I unfortunately started in my Senior year.

## Current Initiatives

- Cybersecurity-Capstone
    - HTB-Dante
        - This is one half of our Cybersecurity Capstone work and involves:
            - Solving and obtaining flags from the HTB-Dante Network
            - Writing a polished report with a checkpoint due in late-February
    - Reverse-Engineering
        - The other half this capstone involves choosing and executing a project on a topic of our choice in the Cybersecurity umbrella
        - I've always been interested in Reverse Engineering and this gives me the excuse I need to start learning
        - This half is much more nebulous and open-ended than the above and is subject to change as the semester unfolds
        - We will also be writing a polished report for this project as well
    - Notes
        - We are required to submit worklogs each week detailing the tasks we performed that week
        - This is also pretty open-ended, but I plan on documenting them in Markdown in the `/Cybersecurity-Capstone/Notes` subdirectory
        - These will be the main material that gets turned into the two required reports
- District Docket
    - This project is for my CSIT capstone (which is different than the above capstone)
    - The code for this project doesn't reside here because we are working with the Dekalb County Community Partnership and is thus not available to publish here
- Delta Chi
    - This is where I store anything Delta Chi Fraternity-related that I can publish

## Past Initiatives

- Criminal-Law
    - During my first-semester senior year, I took a Criminal Law class and this is where my notes are stored
- HTB
    - HTB
        - Writeups for the HTB machines I've solved
    - HTB-Pics
        - Screenshots used in said reports
    - HTB-scripts
        - Any scripts used to solve the above machines
- Project-Management
    - During my first-semester senior year, I also took a Project-Management class and this is where my notes are stored
