# Questions and Discussion I had with Cassie

## Professional Development

- Current process
    - Make the chapter aware of Trine Handshake events
        - Each week at chapter
    - Pass down "Senior Wisdom" to the chapter
        - "Senior Soapbox"
    - Resume reviews with Kyle Pierce (ABT)
- Anything we can be doing better in this area?

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

- IHQ has a fledgling DEI program, but it doesn't really describe activities, resources, and procedures for chapter chairs to follow, do you have any suggestions for things I can do?
- Improve the Gender/Sexuality resources for the chapter
    - What's IHQ's stance on:
        - Gay members
        - Trans members
            - MtF (already initiated when they come out)
            - FtM (came out before PNM status/AM status)
- Race-sensitivity is an issue in fraternity culture
    - How to educate our members better?
- Other fraternities have done
    - Chapter Climate Survey
    - List of Helpful Reading
    - A lot of chapters are in a similar state to ours
